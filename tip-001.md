## Abstract

Tube ID is the identity of a supported blockchain in the tube, which is a constant integer, one for each blockchain. It is used to distinguish the source and destination blockchains of transfers, and avoid misuse of validators' endorsements.

With tube ID, blockchains of different variations (EVM compatible or not) could be supported. Validators could easily use tube ID to manage the blockchains they are willing to endorse.

## Registered Tube IDs

This TIP defines a list of supported blockchains and their registered Tube IDs. Tube ID starts with '1' for mainnets and '2' for testnets. Developers may ask for registering unused ID for their blockchains.
